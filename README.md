# Agent Skills

A personal collection of reusable agent skills, installable with [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [the-gang-t3](./skills/the-gang-t3/) | Ask a panel of models from different labs the same question in parallel through [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code)'s `delegate_task`, then synthesize and cross-pollinate their answers |

## Install

```bash
# Pick skills interactively
npx skills add richard-better/claude-code-skills

# Or install one directly
npx skills add richard-better/claude-code-skills --skill the-gang-t3
```

Add `-g` to install globally instead of into the current project, and `-a <agent>` to target a specific agent (e.g. `claude-code`, `codex`).

## Requirements

- **the-gang-t3** runs inside T3 Code, which provides the `orchestrator_capabilities` and `delegate_task` tools. The panel models must be configured as providers in T3 Code; seats whose model is unavailable are left empty.
